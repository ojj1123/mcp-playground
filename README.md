# MCP playground

## Motivations

- I was feeling that it's hard work to style UIs. Half of my working time is markup even if using the own design system.

- I'm wondering if we could generate **sophisticated** UIs **automatically** using AI editors integrating with MCP (Model Context Protocol). If using our own design system or component libraries, I think we can delegate markup to AI.

- This repository is just sort of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) study using [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol).

## Goals

- Making Cursor assistant for my working.

- Integrating with the own design system or component libraries such as chakra-ui or Material.

- Improving productivity.
